Planning of finances is essential for each and every one, be it a school-going kid or a retired
citizen. The more early you begin to manage your money the better it is. Let’s suppose you
choose not to plan and keep spending as and when you like and one day you wish to purchase
a house but then you cannot as you hardly have any savings left. This is what happens when
you don’t plan and end up overspending.
We tend to overspend when we do not understand what we really need. We keep on spending
to fulfill all our requirements and we lose count of how much we spent. One should understand
the difference between your needs and wants. Things like daily lunch, dinner and house rent
payments are our needs which we will have to incur. But things like play stations, videogames
and movies are always an option and can be done without. If even we do want to splurge on
our wants we can set aside some of our savings over a time period and can buy important
needs like vehicles, house, higher education etc when we have accumulated savings. This is
what planning is all about, to plan, save and help us achieve our financial goals.
When you start early you can always plan for your future financial goals and have the benefit of
meeting them when you want to. This is because you have a longer time horizon to spread out
your investments and manage your portfolio across time. Every school-going kid is taught from
his childhood to count and save money for his future so that he can use them appropriately to
finance his financial goals.
This tutorial on financial planning presents various aspects of financial planning for college
students. Financial planning is very important for every individual. If people understand its
significance at a younger age, achieving your future financial goals becomes more convenient
as you can invest in different products to meet your needs.
1. INTRODUCTION
2. FINANCIAL PLANNING
Financial Planning is important as it helps us meet our future goals. Every individual needs to
understand the need to manage his or her finances. Let us look at an example to understand
why.
Activity 1: Prepare your monthly budget by specifying your pocket money, monthly expenses
and savings for the month. You can look at the above example where Shantanu prepares a
plan for his friend’s birthday party to make your monthly budget. You can use the following
box shown below to list out your budget items.
YOUR MONTHLY BUDGET
A: Income
•	 Pocket money
•	 Part-time assignment
•	 Prize
•	 Stipend
•	 Cash gifts, if any
B: Expenses
•	 College fees
•	 Party
•	 Gift
•	 EMI, if any
•	 Lunch
•	 Traveling Expenses
•	 Others
C: Balance (A-B)
7
If your income is greater than your expenses, you are planning your finances adequately. However,
if your balance is negative, you need to start planning your finances right away.
DID YOU KNOW?
IDEALLY YOUR SAVINGS SHOULD BE 20% OF YOUR TOTAL INCOME
PERSONAL BUDGET
Meanwhile, Shantanu has finished with the university level examinations in finance. After
learning about the importance of financial planning Shantanu now wants to manage his
finances well so that he can repay his loan and keep enough funds for his future needs.
Shantanu approaches Nikhil for his advice.
Shantanu: Hello, Nikhil. This time my project was judged to be the best. Your insights really
helped a lot. I wanted to ask you how I could plan my finances.
Nikhil: First of all, you should make a habit of preparing your monthly budget.
Shantanu: How can I do that?
Nikhil: A monthly budget is a detailed plan of your income, monthly expenses, future expenses
and the balance income left with you. (Look at how you prepared the budget plan for the
party earlier and try making new additions and changes to the budget plan as Nikhil guides
Shantanu.)
Nikhil: First write your monthly income on the top. If you are not earning write down the
monthly allowance you get as your pocket money to meet your expenses. Write down the
items on which you are likely to spend money. Write an itemized detail of the money you
spend through the month. Also, identify the unnecessary expenses you make through the
month. In case you have any future plans to buy or sell assets keep a note of it. What’s more
important is you should maintain this record and keep writing details every day. One should
be very honest too. It is important to declare the right income and expense figures as your
future plan outcomes will depend on it.
Shantanu: I already feel that I can do it now. Is that all?
Nikhil: Not yet! Let me touch upon few more things in addition to what I had told you earlier
before your exams. You should know your assets and liabilities. Asset is a resource that you
own and can be easily converted to cash. Remember the money bag I spoke of earlier? The
money bag is an asset as it has your monthly income and it can be easily converted to cash.
Assets are resources, which you can use to pay off your debts. On the other hand, liability is an
obligation to pay back. Your monthly bills and other expenses are all your liabilities, which you
should pay up using your assets. Always structure your budget plan by writing your income
under the head ‘assets’ and expenses under the head ‘liabilities’.
IMPORTANCE OF FINANCIAL PLANNING
SHANTANU: I have been assigned a project on ‘Financial Planning’ and I am facing a few
difficulties. Could you help me solve them?
NIKHIL: Sure. Do tell me your queries. 

9
SHANTANU: Why is it important to manage our finances?
NIKHIL: If you manage your finances, you would be able to use your money better. If you
don’t, you would not be able to meet your needs. Let’s say today is the first of the month. You
have got your salary and you spend all the funds in your money bag on clothes and other
accessories, then you would not have any money left to pay off your monthly bills and other
payments through the month. Learning to save is essential or else you cannot meet your basic
needs even though you earn a handsome pay.
SHANTANU: I really need to keep this in mind. What is the next step?
Step 2: Identify your financial goals
SHANTANU: It is said that one needs to identify his or her investment objective before he
starts planning his finances. Is it true?
NIKHIL: Defining one’s investment objective is vital before planning for finances. Your goals
will tell you how you should manage your finances so that when you wish to meet your goals
you have enough funds with you. You can then plan accordingly how much you need to save
today for the future plans and how much returns you will receive on your investments to fulfill
your future needs.
Your goals may be either short term, medium term or long term. Your short term goals could
be say to pursue an MBA after a year, to purchase a two-wheeler etc. Short terms goals are
defined to be met in up to three years. Medium term goals could be financing your marriage
expenditure, to gift your parents a vacation package etc. These goals are defined as those
needs which have to be met up to 5 years. Your long term goals could be to purchase a new
house and these would have to be met after tenure of 5 years. You could further define the
target date for each of these goals along with an approximate amount of funds you would
require to meet these needs.
Step 3: Identifying any financial issues
NIKHIL: At this step you should also find out if you have any loans to be repaid. Someone
might have monthly insurance premiums to be paid, retirement plan premiums, or a home
loan. Determining your liabilities is extremely essential so that you do not overspend and end
up defaulting on your EMI (equated monthly installments) payment. You should also know
how much is your monthly expenditure; i.e., the money spent on food items, clothes, water,
electricity and other amenities used so that you can allocate some of your funds to pay for it.
SHANTANU: So not only is the source of income important, but we should also know our
liabilities too. Am I right?
NIKHIL: Absolutely. Let me make this simpler. Imagine you have a money bag and on the 1st
of every month you get your monthly pay and the money bag gets filled. This money bag is
your asset now and the monthly expenses like food bills, loan repayments, etc. become your
liabilities. Money flowing into the bag will be your income and money flowing out of your
bag will be your payments to others for the services you use. With time your liabilities would
increase as you grow old. You would have to support your spouse, your kids and so on.
Step 4: Preparation of Financial Plan
NIKHIL: One should prepare their financial plan depending upon various factors like his
income, risk taking ability, age group and investment objective. 
10
SHANTANU: Oh! So this means that financial planning would differ for me and you as well?
NIKHIL: Yes. This is because the income for two individuals may not necessarily be the s a m e
and his personal needs could also be different and so on. A financial planner needs to note such
differences and then accordingly suggest investment avenues for the investors. If he considers
all the investors to be the same then an investor might not be able to meet his financial needs
or objectives and the basic purpose of financial planning would not be met with. Suppose you
approach me to help you manage your finances. I would first take a look at your income, which
would be your pocket money. Since your income is much less than an earning individual the
investment avenues that I would suggest you would be different from what I would suggest an
individual who is currently working. You must understand that since your needs are different
from others you need to make investments that would suit your profile. Many investors fail
to understand this. Many individuals in the hope of making big profits invest most of their
funds into below investment grade investments which offer high returns. One may profit if
they perform well or else they may lose money. Every individual has a different risk appetite
and needs to keep this in mind before he chooses which product to invest in.
SHANTANU: Could you please tell me about risk appetite?
Nikhil: Good question! Risk appetite is the risk taking ability of an investor. This varies from
person to person. If I am a rich businessman and my monthly income ranges to lakhs of
rupees, I might feel that losing a few thousand rupees would not be a matter of concern if I
can make high returns. People who are rich or who have a high net worth are willing to invest
aggressively unlike others. But if I am a middle class worker, then I might not be able to accept
such huge losses. As a rich man, I can afford taking losses or in other words I am willing to take
high risks. But as a middle class worker, I can’t afford to take high risks. I might be able to take
up losses in a few hundred rupees only. If I am a retired individual, my risk appetite would be
different as I would need a regular income to support my personal needs like medical bills,
health supplements, etc., which means that I would not be willing to take risks. Risk appetite
is allotted to individuals on a scale from low to high. For a retired individual, the risk appetite
would be low whereas for the businessman the risk appetite would be high. But for a middle
class worker it would be moderate. There are various investment avenues like equity, debt,
commodities, Forex, etc., each of which is termed as an asset class. You can choose to invest in
any of these asset classes provided you understand that each of these asset classes differ from
one another in terms of risks and returns. You should make investments depending upon your
risk taking ability.
Step 5: Implementing your financial plan
NIKHIL: After preparing your financial plan you need to review and revise your plan to stay
up-to-date and relevant to the economic climate and your changing lifestyle.
SHANTANU: Is this what is meant by portfolio management?
NIKHIL: Yes. The entire collection of investments you make is termed as the portfolio. Suppose
you have Rs 1000 and you invest 50% in equity and the rest in debt securities. Your entire
investment would be your portfolio which has a value of Rs 1000 currently. This value might
increase or decrease depending upon the market movements, which will bring a change in
the value of the securities you hold. Nowadays investors use various portfolio management
services to help them manage their investments. Every asset is different from the other in
terms of risk and returns.
Every step in the process of financial planning is equally important. Most of the investors
declare their income, risk tolerance levels and also make investments but neglect monitoring
their investments. If you do not watch over your investments, even if it had been making gains
it may become a loss making investment. Thus there is a need to periodically review your
portfolio and make changes in the portfolio as the situation demands. Suppose the equity
investments have not performed well for the last quarter and you hold up to 70% of your
portfolio in the shares of these companies, then you cannot continue holding the same
portfolio. You might have to shift your funds to other asset classes that are less risky like bonds
till the markets recover.

3. SMART GOALS
A critical first step in managing your finances is to be able to setup SMART financial objectives.
Your goals have to be S (specific), M (measurable, motivated), R (realistic, resource-based), and
T (time-bound, can be monitored). Many people make the mistake of setting general goals
which, more often than not, will not materialize.
Objectives Goals Incorrect Approach Right Approach
Specific You need to know
exactly what you want
and when
I need money to pay
my college fees in a
year’s time
I will save the money of
Rs. 50,000 to pay my fees
at college
Measurable Your goal should be
measurable so that you
know when you can
achieve it
I will pay off my
debts to my friends
In the next six months, I
will return Rs 3000 to my
two friends for lending
me their money.
Attainable Your goals should be
reasonable i.e. within
your reach
I will save money. I will save Rs. 2,000
each month by cutting
down on eating out and
partying.
Realistic Your goals need to be
based on resources
and tasks that you can
reasonably accomplish.
If I save money I will
be rich.
If I save regularly, need
not borrow more money,
I can pay off my debts
by next year and will
have enough savings till I
begin to earn.
Time-bound Goals with timelines
allow you to track your
progress and encourage
you to keep going until
you reach your goal
I will save money for
my vehicle
I will save Rs.10000 a year
for the next 2 years for
my vehicle.
4. HOW TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS?
NIKHIL: Now that you know the different aspects of financial planning let us chalk out few
goals of yours and how you can go about achieving them. Tell me what are your goals for the
future?
SHANTANU: Yes. I would first like to finance my education and then a two wheeler.
NIKHIL: You should write your goals depending upon when you want to achieve them this will
help you categorize them.
12
Table 1: Goals for Mr. Shantanu Age: 21 Years
Goals Goal Type Name Target Date Amount(Lakh)
Education Short term Self 2011 05.00
Two-wheeler Medium term Self 2014 00.50
Vacation Medium term Parents 2016 1.00
Marriage Long term Self 2018 10.00
House Long term Self 2020 60.00
Once you do this you should plan your investments accordingly.
Goal Goal Type Target Date Action plan required
Education Short term 2012 Finance your fees partly from your parents
funds and partly by taking loan
Two-wheeler Medium term 2015 By 2013 it is expected you would begin to
earn money. So you can save 10 thousand
every year so in three years you can have
enough funds to buy a vehicle
Vacation Medium term 2018 Also keeping in mind this goal you can
make suitable investments like equity and
mutual funds to earn sufficient returns
to fund the vacation for your parents
provided you plan well in advance
Marriage Long term 2020 Make investments in equities, debt and
mutual funds which will give you sufficient
returns to cover your expenses
House Long term 2022 You can make investments in Fixed
deposits which will help you to lock away
funds for this goal, however as this would
not be enough you should look at other
options as well
5. RISK V/S RETURNS
Every individual has their own risk taking capacity. Your risk-return profile is your level of risk
tolerance. If you invest in a high risk business like a start up firm your risk would be high. There
are three types of risk return profiles which you can fall under depending upon your source of
funds and the investments you choose to make. They are:
1. Conservative i.e. you take minimal risks ensuring your funds are secure. You prefer
investing in post office deposit schemes, bank fixed deposits, government bonds
2. Moderate i.e. you are willing to take some risks and prefer investing in mutual fund
schemes
3. Aggressive i.e. you are willing to take high risks and prefer investing in equity,
commodities markets and you may even be speculating for returns.
There is an important investment principle which says the level of your returns depends on
the level of risk you take. While you stay invested it is crucial you take necessary measures to
manage your risk. Once you invest in any asset class you should monitor your investments and
keep yourself updated about various market happenings to avoid any pitfalls. Always check
the potential risks when quoted returns are unusually high.
13
6. THE POWER OF COMPOUNDING
Time is an influential factor when it comes to investments. Your returns depend upon the time
you enter and exit. Compounding is a concept which when followed with dedication gives
great rewards. However, it rewards better when savings are compounded over longer horizons.
Compounding, in short, basically means earning interest on previously earned interest. Let us
look at an example:
If you set aside a sum of say Rs 5,000 every month from the age of 25, at a return interest rate of
10%, in 60 years you will have with you funds worth about Rs 1 crore (Rs 10 million) and more.
However, if you start at 40 with the same amount and return rate of interest, the retirement
fund will amount to only around Rs 33 lakh (Rs 3.3 million).
Consider you invest Rs 100 for a period of 5 years.
Year Amount (at 10% fixed rate
of interest)
Floating rate of
interest
Amount (terms of floating
rate)
1 110 10% 110
2 121 9% 119.9
3 133.1 12% 133.50
4 146.41 10% 146.8508
5 161.05 9% 160.06
Notice here that the Rs 100 that you had invested will fetch you Rs 161.05 in 5 years in terms of
fixed interest rate and similar results in terms of floating rate as well. Thus in 5 years you stand
a chance of making around 60% return!!!
Thus compounding is a tool that helps you make phenomenal growth in your investments over
a period of time. Thus the more time you have, the more money you are capable of making
and this is exactly why financial planning is so very important.
Recurring deposits and SIPs can help you on this front, ease in payment of this regular
investment amount through a direct debit facility or post-dated cheque can help you execute
your compounding strategy.
14
7. INFLATION EFFECTS ON INVESTMENTS
Inflation is rise in prices for goods and services. As the prices rise, lesser number of people can
buy them. Let’s say the rate of petrol changes from Rs 40 to Rs 45, with no change in quality.
Then the price difference indicates inflation.
If you are earning returns of 10% over your investment of Rs 5000 which is Rs. 500 after a year
and the inflation rate is 11% then you will end up giving your returns due to high inflation rates.
Hence always ensure your returns are above the inflation rates. You should also understand
the time value of money.
Time Value of Money
SHANTANU: Yes. I know about the time value of money. I remember our Investment Professor
telling us about this. He gave us an assignment to help us understand this. He asked us to find
out the value of things in our house, which we use the most, and to list down their price or
value today and their value 5 years back. We found out that when we compared their values,
their value today was much higher.
NIKHIL: This is because of the time value of money. As time passes you will realize that if 10
years back you could afford to purchase a full lunch for Rs 10, today you might afford to get few
pieces of vegetables only. This means that the value of a thousand rupee note would be higher
today than after five years. If you invest Rs 1000 today, at 5% per annum, then after a year you
would receive Rs 1050. Thus Rs 1000 received today is equivalent to Rs 1050 received after a
year. In order to protect one’s money from losing its value people invest their money. Now I
guess you understand your rationale for investing in stock markets was wrong. What you also
need to know is that borrowing and spending is not that easy. When you borrow you take up
a liability that is you agree to repay and the amount you repay is the original amount you had
borrowed along with an interest payment, which is levied upon the amount you borrow.
Activity 2: List down the various items you often use and write down their value today and
its value 10 years back. Compare the two values and observe how the value of money has
changed over time.
TIME VALUE OF MONEY
Commodity Price then (2001-02) Price now (2009-10) % increase in
inflation
Sugar (1kg) 16.00 40.00 150.00%
Cooking Oil (5 liters) 290.00 500.00 72.41%
Gold (10 grams) 4474.00 17138.00 283.06%
Silver (1 kg) 7868.00 28345.00 260.26%
Rice (1 kg) 14.00 35.00 150.00%
Wheat (1 kg) 10.00 30.00 200.00%
Petrol (1 liter) 33.46 48.83 45.94%
Diesel (1 liter) 19.88 36.74 84.81%
Source: For bullion prices – RBI, the prices of other commodities are approximate prices from web sources
Example 2: Now if you want to buy a house after 20 years the amount of saving and investment
required to be made every month at various rates of return to build up corpus of various
amounts will be;
Corpus
required /
Interest
rate
50,00,000 60,00,000 70,00,000 80,00,000 90,00,000 10,00,000
6% 10,973.44 13,168.12 15,362.81 17,557.50 19,752.19 21,946.87

NIKHIL: Well, when it comes to investments one should
remember that investing in various asset classes has its own
advantage. When you distribute your investment across various
asset classes, your risk is balanced out across the portfolio. Let
me give you an example.
(Look at how Nikhil explains diversification in the following
steps.)
NIKHIL: Suppose the amount available with you for investing is Rs 10, 000. You make
investments in various assets. You invest Rs 3500 each in equity (which are shares or stock
of a company) and bonds which may be government securities or corporate bonds. The rest
of the funds are allocated to commodities, let’s say gold or silver, which is termed as bullion
in commodity markets. Now, say the company’s shares in which you have invested have not
performed well then there is a possibility that you may lose money on the capital invested in
these shares. However, since you have invested in other asset classes the decrease in value
of any one asset will be balanced by the gain in other asset classes. This is the benefit of
diversification. Diversification thus reduces the risk of the portfolio. If two asset classes are
correlated, it implies that when one asset class does not perform well the other asset also loses
value depending upon the extent to which they are correlated. If they are positively correlated
the direction of movement would be the same but if they are negatively correlated they would
move in opposite directions. Investors park their funds in different asset classes with a motive
to even out the losses in one asset with the gains in other asset classes. One should always
analyze the fundamentals of the company before investing in its products. If one wishes to
invest in equity markets, he or she may choose to do so by investing in blue chip companies
which have good fundamentals rather than investing in companies whose business you do
not understand.
Asset Allocation
Every asset class has its own risks and returns. Equity investments are considered to be risky
investments as they might lead to erosion of entire capital invested, whereas government
bonds are considered to be risk free as you are confident that the government will not default
on its interest payments. When it comes to choosing what investments would suit you,
a financial planner will tell you about various asset classes and will help you allocate your
funds appropriately. This is termed as asset allocation. In other words, now you would begin
implementing your financial plan. Asset allocation is a technique for investing your money
into various asset classes. Your planning consultant will suggest assets that would suit you
according to your income and risk appetite. If your risk appetite is high, he would suggest risky
assets, but if your risk appetite is low, then he would suggest less risky assets. While allocating
your funds to various assets, it is important to see that you distribute your funds across various
assets to benefit from diversification.
Asset Allocation
Funds Rs 10, 000
Investments - Stocks Rs 3500
Bonds Rs 3500
Bullion Rs 3000

8. SAVINGS V/S INVESTMENTS
Savings mean the funds you keep aside in safe custody like bank saving accounts. While
investing on the other hand means to purchase various financial instruments which will pay
you a return on some future date. The difference between savings and investment is that
savings is simply idle cash while investments help your funds to grow over a period of time.
We can meet our short term needs with our savings but to meet our long term goals we need
to make investments. Savings help to protect our principal while investments help us earn
returns over our investments
9. LOANS V/S INVESTMENTS
People always are confused whether they should avail a loan or build investments to achieve
their financial goal. Both of the options are different and should be availed appropriately. The
following points are worth remembering:
•	 It purely depends on your financial strength and other factors.
•	 Credit card debts and personal loans are very costly
•	 If you have a loan with a low interest rate and tax benefits as in the case of home loans, it is
advantageous to go for a loan. If you have an investment plan where you can make good
return, and then you may opt for investment.
•	 You have to be sure that the investment is not risky and will not affect your family if you
lose the money. For example, you are investing huge sums in share market, instead of
closing the existing debts, that is too much risk.
Basics & Dangers of Credit Cards
SHANTANU: I was thinking of getting a credit card? Should I?
NIKHIL: People of your age fancy credit cards, they feel that having a credit card is like a status
symbol because it gives them the ease of payment at any time but what they forget is the bill
they need to pay later.
Disadvantages
1. Credit cards come with a lot of additional charges like interest rates, service charges etc.
in exchange for the credit offered by them. People forget to read these terms before
purchasing a credit card.
2. Credit cards often tempt people to spend more even if they do not have money today as
they have the comfort of paying back later.
3. People tend to purchase more credit cards so as to extend their income and later end up
piling huge sums of debt.
Advantages
1. Credit cards offer a number of gifts like cash back, holiday vouchers and other coupons on
making purchases through using credit cards.
2. Credit cards offer the benefit of traveling without cash.
3. Credit cards offer cash in advance and hence are easier to use.

It is advised that one should learn to save and manage their funds wisely. Always try to cut back
on your spending and rethink before you buy any items other than your basic needs. People
at your age are very keen on electronic gadgets and wish to spend on the latest in town. But
what you do not realize is these gadgets cost quite a lot on your pockets, squeezing your bank
accounts to an extent that you would not be able to pay up for your education.
SHANTANU: I remember even I need to pay back my educational loan after I complete my
graduation. I had completely forgotten about this.
NIKHIL: I am glad you told me about your loan before you registered for a credit card. If you
already have debt to repay why should you go for more debt? It will not help your financial
position. You should instead make investments that will help you repay the loan and also
support your needs for the future.
10.INVESTMENT VEHICLES
Indian markets offer a number of financial instruments like equities, debt, mutual funds,
currencies and commodities in addition to other structured products. However their choice
should be appropriate for the investor depending upon his or her risk profile and other
investment horizon.
For younger age group individuals since the investment horizon is long one can invest in
products which offer capital appreciation or growth on investments. One should always check
that he or she has allocated funds to spend on his or her immediate needs before investing.
Equity Products:
These are company sponsored instruments like shares or stocks of the company’s capital. These
instruments offer the investor with shareholder rights where in investors can participate in the
annual general meeting and have the right to vote. These products earn returns depending
upon the profits made by the company from its operations. The returns may thus fluctuate
depending upon the profitability of the company business. These products offer a number of
benefits like Investors should understand the company business very well before investing.
One can choose to invest in these instruments when they have a longer investment horizon.
Mutual Funds:
A mutual fund is generally a professionally managed pool of money from a group of Investors.
These products may range from asset class specific portfolio or a mixed group of asset classes.
But the choice of scheme or plan should depend upon your investment objective. Investing
in mutual funds helps in diversifying your portfolio and thus reduces the risk in your portfolio.
These products are considered to be ideal for beginners who lack the necessary expertise to
manage their funds.
Structure wise there are two types of mutual funds – Open ended and closed ended.
OPEN ENDED SCHEME sells and repurchases units at all times. When fund sells, investor buys
and when the investor redeems, the fund repurchases the units. Buying or redeeming is at a
price based on the NAV (Net Asset Value).
CLOSED ENDED SCHEME, after the offer closes, investors are not allowed to buy or redeem
units from the fund. Closed end funds are listed on stock exchanges to enable investors to buy
or sell units. 
19
Insurance products:
Insurance is more a safety option than an option to invest. We buy insurance to protect
ourselves from unforeseen events like death, accidents, theft of valuables etc. Some of the
common insurance plans are:
•	 Unit Linked Insurance Plans
•	 Term / Term with Return of Premium Plans
•	 Health Insurance
•	 Personal Accident Insurance
•	 Insurance cover for your Home / Car
•	 Insurance cover to protect your family from liabilities
•	 Travel insurance
The value of the cover that you opt for should depend on your need for protection. Life
insurance helps your dependent family members to cover daily expenditure in case of any sad
demise. Medical insurance covers your hospitalization expenses in case of any critical illnesses.
Within this category, products may have different payout structures and limits for various
heads of expenditure. The hospitalization coverage may be reimbursement based plans or
fixed benefit plans. These plans aim to cover the more frequent medical expenses.
11. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT PLANS:
Starting early is the key to financial planning; today you don’t necessarily need to inherit
wealth from family to get wealthy. SIP or systematic investment plans are an excellent means
by which you can start investing small, fixed sums of money at regular intervals, (commonly 1
month) most

THE CONCEPT OF RUPEE COST AVERAGING:
SIP uses the concept of rupee cost averaging. Let me illustrate this with the help of an
example:
Month January February March April
A: Amount
invested (Rs
per month)
500 500 500 500
B: NAV 5 10 15 12
C: No. of units
(A/B)
100 50 33.33 41.06
Rs 500 invested in January would fetch you 100 units compared to just 41 units in the month
of April. Thus by investing the same amount of Rs 500 every month, you buy more units when
the market is down and buy fewer units when the market is up. Thus lowering your average
cost per unit. SIP acts as an excellent means by which you can save time and efforts in tracking
the stock market movements.
DID YOU KNOW?
A ONE TIME INVESTMENT CARRIES MORE RISK THAN A SIP.
12. HOW NOT TO LOSE MONEY?
Updating oneself with the current happenings is a must for every investor as he will then be
aware of various events in the financial markets. In addition to this, there are various matters
that need to be looked into to keep a check on your portfolio. If you do not then you will end
up losing all your returns
You should make a habit of analyzing your investments, valuing your investments and
rebalancing your portfolio.
If you are investing in mutual funds, you can keep a watch on the daily NAV (Net asset value)
of the particular fund just like you watch the daily stock prices. You should also be aware of
various financial ratios like profit margins, solvency ratios and liquidity ratios, which give you
an idea of how the said company is in terms of profitability of its projects, share value and
other factors. If you are investing in bonds you should be aware of the bond’s maturity, the
rate of interest and other elements of the bond. If you are aware that the company has earlier
defaulted on its interest payments on its borrowings, then it is better not to invest in securities
of that firm. It is always safer to have a good know-how on valuation techniques like ratio
analysis and investment pay-off.
You should keep an eye on how the value of your investments changes depending upon
fluctuations in the markets, economic issues and other factors.
You can analyze your investments by looking at financial statements of the companies, see
how they have performed in the past and if you expect that the company will perform well in
future, then you can think of investing in that company. You should try to familiarize yourself 
21
with the financial statements of the company to understand how the company utilizes its
finances. You should be wary of the publicity gimmicks that a company would put up to
impress the masses. You should develop a knack to read through what the company writes
up on its performance as a part of the results declared. Every investment you make is crucial
hence you should monitor it from the time you invest into the investment product till the time
you receive your proceeds from the investment. The time period from the beginning of the
investment, that is when you pay out from your funds to buy an asset, till the time you receive
your proceeds from the sale of the asset is termed as the Investment Life Cycle. Every investor
should monitor his investments from the time of entry till the time of exit. Throughout the time
horizon you stay invested you should maintain a check on your investments. The time horizon
varies across investors. Some may enter and exit trades within few minutes, hours or within a
day while some stay invested for years. But it is always advised that investors should remain
invested for a longer time horizon to benefit from an investment. The longer you stay invested
you attract less taxes also. But many do not do that in the hope of making quick profits.
Tax Planning
Every individual should know about the tax implications on his or her investments. Every
individual is charged income tax but the charges vary depending upon under which tax
bracket he falls.
However when it comes to investments you can get a tax rebate.
Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows you to get a rebate up to a limit of Rs. 1, 00, 000 which
is irrespective of under which tax bracket you are. This covers investments like –
•	 Provident Fund
•	 Public Provident Fund
•	 Life insurance premium
•	 Pension plans
•	 Equity Linked Saving Schemes of mutual funds
•	 Infrastructure bonds
•	 National Savings Certificate
Section 80D of the Income Tax Act also allows you to get a rebate over premium payments
of medical insurance plans. This is over and out of the Rs 1 lakh limit offered by Section 80C.
80D provides a deduction up to Rs 30,000. For senior citizens, the deduction up to Rs. 20,000
is allowable. This deduction is available for premium paid on medical insurance for oneself,
spouse, parents and children. It is also applicable to the cheques paid by proprietor firms.
This act also exempts home loan payments. For self occupied properties, interest paid on a
housing loan up to Rs 150,000 per year is exempt from tax. However, this is only applicable for
a residence constructed within three financial years after the loan is taken and also the loan if
taken after April 1, 1999.
